                <p>But what about the roads?</p>
                You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand. Don't worry kiddo,
                    where there's a demand there will be a
                    supply; we'll all have our roads.

                <p>Is taxation theft?</p>
                If i came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, demanded that you and your neighbors give me a percentage of
                your income, in return for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for, would you consider that theft?
